#### When you add or modify code, always write specification documentation
Specification documentation should be placed under docs/features, corresponding to the code file location
For example: Code server/middleware/auth.ts should have a specification document at docs/features/server/middleware/auth-README.md

#### When viewing code, also refer to specification documentation
Specification documentation is located under docs/features, corresponding to the code file location
For example: When reading code server/middleware/auth.ts, try to read the specification document at docs/features/server/middleware/auth-README.md
